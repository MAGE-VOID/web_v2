        <Paragraph>
          Trading foreign exchange (Forex) on margin involves high risk and is
          not suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work
          both for and against you. Before deciding to invest in Forex, you
          should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of
          experience, and risk appetite. There is a possibility that you could
          sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore
          you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.
