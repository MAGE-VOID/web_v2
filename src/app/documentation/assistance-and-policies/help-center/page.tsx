        <FAQBox title="What if my account is in a currency other than USD?">
          No matter what currency your account is in, The Expert Advisor handles
          it automatically.
        </FAQBox>

        <FAQBox title="How much do you earn per month?">
          The monthly profit will always depend on the risk that the trader
          wants to use.
        </FAQBox>

        <FAQBox title="Do I need to stop EA's during major news events?">
          No, there is no need to stop Expert Advisors in these situations, a
          good expert advisor handles these scenarios internally.
        </FAQBox>

        <FAQBox title="I use the EA for the first time and I don't know what to do. Can you guide me?">
          Of course! You can either take a look at detailed step-by-step text
          guides on this website or simply write to me and ask for help.
        </FAQBox>

        <FAQBox title="Is it necessary to use a VPS?">
          It is not necessary to use a VPS, you can run the EA on your home PC.
          However, most people wont be comfortable running the PC 24/7, which
          is why most EA buyers use a VPS service to do that.
        </FAQBox>

        <FAQBox title="Why should i let a robot trade for me?">
          Robots allow the automation of analytical and trading processes. They
          can open and close trades based on certain criteria or calculations
          that it has been programmed to do. They are capable of opening and
          closing orders much faster and much more efficiently than a human
          ever possibly could, and they can do this 24 hours a day. Robots never
          sleep, never get tired and dont have human emotions, which makes for
          an ideal trading tool. A human will simply NEVER trade better than a
          robot.

        <FAQBox title="Is it necessary to use a VPS?">
          It is not necessary to use a VPS, you can run the EA on your home PC.

        <FAQBox title="What Timeframe should I use?">
          It does not matter the Timeframe in which you put the expert advisor,
          but we recommend M5.
        </FAQBox>

        <FAQBox title="Drawdown in the backtest is low, so can I use a higher risk?">
          It is up to you but I dont recommend more than 2%.
        </FAQBox>

        <FAQBox title="How often do you plan updates?">
          1. The Expert Advisors or indicators that are launched are complete
          products. However, we constantly monitor the market, as well as your

          The Forex market is a 24-hour market. Forex trading commences in
          Wellington, New Zealand and moves around the globe as business days
          begin in each financial centre. The major global financial centres

        </FAQBox>

        <FAQBox title="What makes exchange rates move?">
          A variety of fundamental and technical aspects can cause an exchange
          rate to move. The most notable influences include interest rates,
          inflation and political stability. Sometimes, governments will buy or
          sell a currency in an effort to influence its value with a view to
          having a broader effect on the country economy. This is known as
          &quot;central bank intervention&quot; and can have a significant
          impact on the value of a currency. Given the size and diversity of
          participants, no one single factor can influence the Forex market for
          any significant length of time.
        </FAQBox>

        <FAQBox title="Is trading the Forex market expensive?">
          No, trading Forex has never been cheaper or more accessible. Traders
          can now trade on institutional grade pricing with leverage of up to
          2000:1. It is, however, important to remember that although trading on
          leverage can maximise profits, it can also amplify losses.
